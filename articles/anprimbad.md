# Anarcho-primitivism?
![monke](/monke.jpeg)

Anarcho-primitivism (anprim) is often cast as a bad ideology, but only as a straw man. Against the steel-man arguments, most pundits would in honesty actually have to agree with anprims, or if lacking emotional maturity, resort to critiquing the presenters of the idea. To my knowledge, there exists no honest discussion of anprim logic that draws all the logic to its ultimate conclusion, so it is about time.

I will primarily draw arguments from Theodore Kaczynski's past statements, mostly from his books "Industrial society and its future" and ["Anti-tech revolution: Why and how"](https://archive.org/details/theodore-john-kaczynski-anti-tech-revolution-why-and-how). Some of the self-declared anprim "moderates" will disagree with him, however their contentions won't hold water, as I will argue for later.

## 1 What is anarcho-primitivism?
To begin, it is not "ludditism". Luddites want to undo only the most recent disrupting piece of technology. Where wider "primitivism" wants to comprehensively reduce the technological complexity of society closer to that of "natural" humans, "returning" us for example from guns to spears, ovens to campfires, and so on.

The steel-man wager of anarcho-primitivism, is that it is better to fight against technology to survive a bit longer, even if technology does develop back again or whatever, than it is to be either exterminated, enslaved, or deprived of agency by it. That would for instance mean being eaten by the sun in some millions of years would be an acceptable outcome versus living under technology for a kjillion years until the heat death.

It makes a few assumptions we will consider:
- Humans will be exterminated, enslaved, or deprived of agency by technology.
- Humans being exterminated, enslaved, or deprived of agency is a bad thing.
- Life under the techno-industrial system (TIS) will either be death or worse than death. So whether or not ending the TIS is possible is unimportant. Hence: Ends justify the means.

## 2 Technological being bad
it won't be really bad within the next few hundred years probably, but it will still be really "bad" eventually

yup, no contention there



## 3 Is technology inevitable?
yes, it will always go that route no matter what you do

tech will redevelop, even if we exhaust all the oil and etc. tis evolution

## 4 Do "humans" matter?

it really boils down to this. and it really depends on your perspective almost (not quite, because the purpose statement says to avoid whimsy and only pursue progress)

the most fervent of anprims are "human absolutist", while others are "human essentialist"

I say worship consciousness, not the human form

meaning is not in whimsicalism (as anprim would sort of imply), but in breakout

leaving humans as a "product of nature" is also pointless

## 5 Collapse of the techno-industrial system
is it possible, plausible, at what cost, and etc.

Ted states complex systems inevitably collapse

ideas like "creative reconstruction" by david skrbina are jokes. gradual depopping is also joke

would be mass famine

nuclear war yes, which is scary, as the 99.99% argument means they can do basically whatever they want

self-sustaining space colonies would almost be a hard time limit

## 6 Is anarcho-primitivism morally permissible?
This is a weak argument, however still a pertinent one for the principle-fixated. And that is how anarcho-primitivism would require the depopulation of 99.99% of the current world population (ca. 8 billion) if going by common estimates of pre-agricultural food availability. 

Moderate proponents say the depopulation can occur gradually with minimal suffering, however the radicals don't believe that is possible, implying a gruesome end for that amount of people. And again, there is good reason to believe the radicals are correct here.

## 7 Conclusion
In the end, whether or not Theodore Kaczynski was right really does depend on your personal opinion.

- If you believe the human body should be preserved unto itself, or believe in whimsy relating to the human condition, you must become an anprim.
- All honest anprims must work towards the thermonuclear annihilation of the Earth.

Personally, I could get behind all that, but I'm afraid I can't condone the philosophy of someone that hurt people that was manipulated by CIA mindcontrollers and invented an ideology to cope with being lonely and hating people and clearly is just a deranged madman with no coherent argumentation. So I will have to side with my corporate techno-oligarch transhumanist overlords on this one.
