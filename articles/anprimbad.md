# Anarcho-primitivism?
![monke](/monke.jpeg)

You will constantly hear anarcho-primitivism (anprim) is a bad ideology, but you will rarely hear why. And if actually pitted against the steel-man arguments, most anti-anprim proponents would find themselves wordless or resort to ad-hominen attacks along the lines of "but uncle Ted bombed people!". Hence, it is about time there was a proper debunk of anprim ideology.

I will primarily draw arguments from [Theodore Kaczynski's past statements](https://archive.org/details/theodore-john-kaczynski-anti-tech-revolution-why-and-how), mostly from his books "Industrial society and its future" and "Anti-tech revolution: Why and how", to represent the radical side of anarcho-primitivism. And the moderate side has various reputable authors, including .

## 1 What is anarcho-primitivism?

It is primitivism but more realistic

## 2 Will humans be exterminated by technology?

The central wager of anarcho-primitivism, is that it is better to fight against technology to survive a bit longer, even if technology does develop back again, than it is to be exterminated by it.

## 3 Is a benevolent technological regime impossible?

and humans can be happy and live meaningful lives under techregime if they have the opium known as religion

## 4 Does technology inevitably centralize?

## 5 Will technology redevelop?

also the problem of demarcation

## 6 Is the human form worth preserving?

I argue the most fervent of anprims are "human absolutist", while others are "human essentialist"

leaving humans as a "product of nature" is also pointless

## 7 Is collapse of the techno-industrial system probable?

Ted states complex systems inevitably collapse

## 8 Can the techno-industrial system be dismantled?

(can progress be reverted)

## 9 Is anarcho-primitivism morally permissible?

This is a weak argument, however still a pertinent one for the principle-fixated. And that is how anarcho-primitivism would require the depopulation of 99.99% of the current world population (ca. 8 billion) if going by common estimates of pre-agricultural food availability. 

Moderate proponents say the depopulation can occur gradually with minimal suffering, however the radicals don't believe that is possible, implying a gruesome end for that amount of people. And again, there is good reason to believe the radicals are correct here.

## 10 Is anarcho-primitivism a low time preference?
