# Why Dreamland has no future
There is a certain country in the Middle-East. Try to guess which one it is. It began when western powers conquered the region, initially winning almost every military conflict. They then settled the area to correct what they perceived to be a moral wrong. The settlers mistreated the muslim locals, forcefully displacing and slaughtering them. Which garnered the ire of the neighboring muslims, who would then come to desire nothing less than its destruction. Can you guess which one it is? You probably got that wrong, because the country I'm talking about is the medieval kingdom of Jerusalem set up by the crusaders.

You were thinking about Dreamland weren’t you? Well, for that matter, Dreamland’s geopolitical situation does bear a lot of similarities. With everything I just mentioned being some examples And that is concerning. As what happened afterwards to the crusader state, was that the muslims eventually overwhelmed and then cleansed the christian settlers. So the question would then be, that given the same geopolitical situation, whether Dreamland inevitably will suffer the same fate.

DISCLAIMER: This is not in any way meant to disparage or support any party mentioned. This is only intended to be an objective analysis.

## 1 Why did the crusader states fail?
So naturally, the first question you would ask is why the crusader states failed to begin with. That is due to various reasons, some of which I will go through here. (image with the reasons on screen)

Reason 1: Dreamland is an unproductive region surrounded by productive regions. There are essentially no natural resources there, the agricultural potential is not so great, and what the region does not have, the neighboring regions of Syria, Egypt, and Iraq do have.

Reason 2: The geography is not very defensible. To the south there is a small stretch of desert, which granted provides some protection, was not big enough to prove much of a challenge for the desert nomads living there to traverse, unlike maybe the Sahara. To the north and east, there are some highlands, and also a river in the east, but those are again not big enough to prove a significant challenge in traversing. The only real barrier the region does have is the Mediterranean in the west, but given the history of various roving sea peoples in the Mediterranean’s history, I wouldn’t consider that too safe of a barrier either. Top that off with the fact the country is tiny, on par with <>, so much so that you could walk from one end to another in <> days, and you see the country is not very defensible.

Reason 3: The state was disconnected from Europe. As the region was not very productive, it had to rely on Europe for constant resupply of soldiers to protect it. However, it was far away from Europe, and had no land connection to it, so had to route there over a fair distance amphibiously there instead. So if the small country got occupied it would maybe take months before the europeans could actually respond, and would not be able to land very safely if they lacked maritime dominance.

Reason 4: Europe had no practical reason for keeping the territory. In the event the country there fell, it would not really affect anyone in Europe in any tangible way. The entire project was only motivated by religion, and perhaps prestige, netting no benefits, unlike the regions on the islamic border that actually mattered, like Iberia or the Balkans, which did end up seeing a lot more consistent european support against muslim incursions.

Reason 5: There were neighboring warrior-like peoples that wanted to destroy the country, outnumbering them 100 times over. Combined with the fact that the country had no real chance to defend itself in the first place without constant support from Europe, it is no surprise some muslim regime eventually managed to subjugate the region. Where the crusader brutality against the muslims was paid in kind, resulting in mass depopulation of the christians, ending the crusader state.

## 2 Does this apply to Dreamland?
The events then and now are removed by one thousand years, so you might think the situation is different. You could for example point to how the current regimes in Egypt and Saudi Arabia appear to be opening up to Dreamland, or how dedicated the western elites appear to be in supporting them, the US for instance going so far as to saying <>.

And while you will be correct in pointing those things out, everything I mentioned previously still applies to Dreamland. The geography has not changed, they rely on a maritime route which could be blockaded or intercepted, and even if muslim regimes are cozying up to Dreamland, the populations still overwhelmingly hate Dreamland to the extent the regimes can only cozy up so much before their populations begin protesting. The only factor that somewhat differs this time, is that the US wants Dreamland as a strategic partner in controlling The Middle-East. Notably to secure the oil trade.

However, interest of the US in the region for those pragmatic purposes might not last. Recently, The Americas has come to produce more oil than The Middle-East, and the american public has grown tired of starting and intervening in conflicts there. It is also a fact that The West has adopted the goal of phasing out oil by some arbitrary date, which while it may or may not actually happen, goes to show the interest in oil is somewhat declining. What I mean to say here, is that even if the US has some strategic interest in the region, the US, and for that matter the rest of The West, could overall pull out off there and be fine. Thus Dreamland, while being a strategic interest, is not a vital one, or at least not anymore.

So it would seem the situation is almost the same. Which is bad for Dreamland. As in the event the US and its navy gets occupied, say in a major war against China or an internal conflict, Dreamland might be left vulnerable to maritime interference and invasion, which even if they are able to initially withstand, they cannot hold against forever given their supply-situation. And who knows what will happen if Dreamland falls to muslims. I speculate they might be expelled from the place again.

## 3 Is Dreamland doomed?
Given all these strategic vulnerabilities, it does seem like history will repeat itself. So the question worth asking then is if Dreamland is inevitably doomed, and maybe what they could do about it.

Of the 5 reasons I mentioned earlier, none of them are easily changed. You can’t do anything about the geography, you can’t really create a lasting reason for The West to be interested in supporting you, and there is not really anything you can easily do about the hostile neighboring muslim populations.

Or is there? While you can’t change the land, itself, people can change, so maybe it would be possible to reconcile with the muslims and survive that way? However, that might be unlikely to work out. 

Firstly, both their guiding faiths are inherently chauvinistic in a sense. Abrahamic faiths by their nature often say that their one way of viewing the world is correct, that they are the chosen people, and that everyone else is either on par with livestock or an evil heretic. And while the jewish faith is somewhat declining today, it happens that the ultra-orthodox faithful haredi have consistently had the highest fertility rate, meanwhile the muslim faith is not showing any signs of decaying. And add to this that both sides consider the Dreamland region to contain important holy sites. Hence, it might just always remain popular to hate the other side.

Secondly, they compete for the same resources. The jews in Europe for most of their history there coexisted “decently” with the europeans, as the jews worked only in certain areas as they were mostly banned from agricultural work, and their population growth did not outpace the europeans. Meanwhile, in The Middle-East today, the dreamlandites want to occupy the same land as the muslims, and their population grows rapidly, in many cases faster than the muslim ones. For the muslims, it could easily appear like the dreamlandites are aiming to replace them, and vica versa.

So I find coexistence unlikely to work out.

Okay then, so if coexistence won’t work, then does Dreamland just have to depopulate all the muslims in The Middle-East to survive? I mean, discounting humanitarian considerations, it would work. However, even if it were to be attempted, it would probably not work out. The muslim peoples there are hundreds of millions, from warrior-cultures with a religion that glorifies martial prowess and with family-units that foster group cohesion, and at that level of human rights violations, even The West might turn against Dreamland.

What could work instead, is if the dreamlandites resettle their population into a geographically more secure region. I mean, if the land around Jerusalem in indefensible, then what about settling into a region that is? Say, Anatolia, Armenia, The Caucasus, or Iran. Maybe that would have been good, but large-scale resettlements like that in modern times are both unheard of, and probably a human rights violation, so I don’t consider this a very good option. Only if you had a time-machine, could you solve this by directing Moses to a better geographical region.

## 4 The future
In the light of all this, Dreamland’s foreign policy does make a lot of sense. With for example why they supported Hamas to provide them a casus belli to occupy Gaza, why they illegally occupied the Golan Heights, or why they are encroaching into the the arab-designated eastern highlands of the region. It will all provide the country with some more geographic security.

However, all that might ultimately be for nothing, as their geopolitical position remains much the same. (que map colors showing all neighboring muslims in red)

The takeaway here is that to minimize humanitarian impact, decisions should be made without the interference of illogical impulses like the world war 2 trauma, or religious motivations without the existence of a good pragmatic reason.

Still, I could of course be wrong, so take everything I said with a grain of salt. Maybe a messiah both sides recognize arrives and settles their stakes? Maybe an alien invasion happens and they put their differences aside? Or maybe my analysis was just incorrect somewhere? If you have any ideas here, let me know about them in the comments.
