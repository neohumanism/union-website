# Understanding leftist ideology
![](/protesters.png)

There are various sentiments about leftist ideologies, which would include socialism, communism, social justice, marxism, syndicalism, among others. Despite all these sentiments, leftist ideology is often poorly understood, so I will provide a description and analysis.

Before we begin, it should be cleared up that due to poor naming conventions and constancy within most leftist schools (which is practiced as a function within them), this article formulates non-standard terms for descriptive purposes.

## 1 The leftist belief-system
Leftism is defined here as genealogically enlightenment-derived belief-systems following a narrative of "oppression". And beyond that, they believe i

The narrative is of how power may be leveraged by the advantaged, the "privileged", or "oppressors", to deliberately or neglectfully harm the less fortunate, the "oppressed". Be it between the upper and lower classes in socialism and marxism, or the franchised majority versus minorities in social justice. Where advantages more precisely means control of physical realities, where this implies all reality exists to serve everyone equally well.

To illustrate the dynamic, leftists will give you the Coconut Island analogy. Where you are stranded on a remote island with another person. And you start off unconscious and he does not, and he hides away all the food on the island. After you wake up, he will either extort you for you to receive food, or uncaringly let you starve. Leftists will describe the hoarder as having oppressed you by using the advantage of being awake first to control the food to your harm.



That segueways to the next point, of how leftism motivates people to action via anger. Whenever power is unfairly leveraged, it is a natural human response to feel anger, compelling you to stand up for those you perceive to be oppressed. Anger of course, coming in many forms, be it righteousness, vengeance, envy, or whatever else.

Leftism proposes to solve that kind of unfairness, by One, tearing down all hierarchies and preventing the opportunity to again attain power over another - A society without hierarchy, a society in “anarchy”, being one where there is no power imbalance, and hence oppression would be impossible. And Two, instilling people the mindset of contributing as much as they can to the collective without expecting compensation in return. Referred to by leftist author Karl Marx as: “From each according to ability, and to each according to needs.”, more concisely as I would call it: “unconditional contribution”.

Thus, leftism makes two fundamental assumptions about the world, that One, humans have the potential to operate off mutual understanding without the need for hierarchy. And Two, that humans can operate off indirect and potentially unreciprocated contributions. The two together in other words being that humans hold the innate potential for good, that “humans are inherently good”, or alternatively that they are “blank slates” onto which perfect behavior can be instilled.

Which for example would accordingly mean that any non-good outcome of human behavior must have been influenced by something else, and so on. That leads us to another major concept within leftism, which are social constructs. While leftist authors did not initially use that exact term, the idea was much the same. That being of how all … information you believe in from your nationality, your gender IDENTITY, your religious SYSTEM, and so on, are all technically discrete constructs set up by societal forces. The idea then being that poor outcomes of human behavior is due to bad social constructs incentivizing poor behavior.

Some examples include how Karl Marx said that religion is used as a metaphorical opium to keep the masses docile in face of oppression. How concepts of wealth and status makes people greedy. Or how gender identity funnels people into different gender roles, which could lead to different outcomes for the individuals, and thereby be a source of leftist grievance.

(drawing: oppression bad -> make angry -> angry people tear down hierarchy and operate society off goodwill instead -> humans are inherently good -> so everything else must be a lie holding us back)

That is about it for the basic leftism. Almost everything else found in leftist thought derives from what I have gone through. Most exceptions are syncretisms, like with christian, african, middle-eastern, and “asian” leftism. Which granted is a majority of self-identified leftists throughout the world, but I think a majority of orthodox leftists would agree the spirit-worshipping leftism practiced in Southeast Asia, the capitalist “communism” in China, baath arab nationalism, most leftist dictators of Africa, and so on, are much more than just superficial opportunists paying lipservice.

Now, given these assumptions about the world, some have called leftism a religion, but that is not an accurate characterization. Religions provide answer to spiritual questions, something leftism does not. While leftism is anti-clerical, stating it to just be another system of oppression, it does not inherently state anything about for example the nature of souls, life meaning, or divine ordinance. To call leftism a religion, would be calling anything that makes assumptions about the world for practical purposes a religion, for which there already is a term, ideology.

## 2 Origin of leftism
Where did leftism come from? 

Leftists don’t refer to their ideology as “leftism”, there was no clear founding date for any ideology which could be considered the “first” leftism, and neither any consensus for what the “first” leftism even was. That makes the exact origin of leftism rather hard to pinpoint. So instead, it might be better to simply look at what leftism evolved from.

The basic leftist ideas as we know them today arose from Europe around the time of The Enlightenment. These ideas could be traced back to a few sources:

1: Humanism. Leftism was based off the idea that every human, regardless of affiliations, deserves a basic level of treatment. In other words, that every human has certain “rights” owed to them by the universe. Which can be summarized as the right to live, and as much freedom as is reasonably possible. The doctrine espoused by leftism then being what leftists believe to be the best way of bringing about those rights.

2: Christianity: Humanism in turn, stems from Christianity. And so too do plenty of other leftist ideas. There is no parallel for leftist thought in societies which did not have the very moralistic christianity of West Europe, and in accordance no other societies that had anything like the western push for leftism.

3: Anarcho-primitivist utopia: The idea that humans have certain “rights” was further corroborated by europeans documenting the lives of primitive hunter-gatherer peoples. Here, I’m specifically talking about the khoisan peoples of South Africa, contacted by the europeans just before of The Enlightenment. While the khoi-related peoples were not hunter-gatherers and we don’t have much good documentation on them, the san-related people were, and they lived almost idyllic lives. People work less than an hour a day, there is no hierarchy, the genders are basically equal, everyone works according to ability and receives according to needs, vices like greed and aggression unheard of, and they did not even have pre-modern ills like high child mortality (*at least not before contact with eurafrican diseases), famines, or unsanitary environments.

So with these sources, and with the context of the historical situation of the europeans at that time, we can theorize leftism arose thusly: That in the overworked newly industrializing cities, under the regimes of the dictatorial absolutist monarchs who sidelined the clergy, people did not really have any strong moral institutions to turn to. Furthermore the discovery that primitive peoples who did not undergo all the progress they did lived better lives rubbed salt into the wound. Hence …

The original political thoughts of the enlightenment centered around classic liberalism, enlightened despotism, and anarchism. All of them were humanist ideologies, but only the anarchist-related ideologies can be categorized as leftist.

Classic liberalism did not seek to get rid of hierarchies or oppression necessarily, only that people should . This was for instance the ideology of the american revolution, and the original ideology of the french one.

And similarly, enlightened despotism was also not leftist. Something which might seem paradoxical today, given the authoritarian lean of socialism and communism, but we’ll get to that later. Enlightened despotism never wanted to get rid of hierarchies or oppression. It only said that a certain hierarchy was the best method of securing those human rights.

So that is where anarchism. In that debate, anarchism said that only without hierarchies would human rights be best secured, as the name would suggest. With that in mind, it would appear anarchism was the kind of proto-leftism, the predecessor of the other leftist ideologies.

The question then of course, is how leftism went from that to the complete opposite, along with all the other crazy offshoots. For that, let us go through the most prominent leftist thoughts of each period in history one at a time.

## 3 Anarchism


Syndicalism and anarchism

Also plentitude christian influence

Democracy ain’t leftism &
Classic liberalism is not leftism. It is ancap. It is too a humanist ideology, #humanism being a religion-ish thing which says that humans have rights and should have a good time and etc., liberalism diffing from leftism because it doesn’t say anything about power being inherently bad or w/e or cares much about anger

They found eventually that power dynamics are inevitable. Also they were uncompetitive as power dynamics can also be mutually beneficial (e.g. farmers need blacksmiths need warriors need managers and vica versa and et cetera)

So because classic leftism is failed, they devised solutions, being the many branches

## 4 Vanguard leftism
Forcefully transition society

It can never work, simply

Did not happen like Marx intended

#also accelerationism

#it is here that most of all rational leftists ended up realizing leftism doesn’t work, and left the left

## 5 Layman leftism
Also describable as "worker's leftism" or "socialism.

Just workers, women, and subaltern groups who want more rights. Not a real belief-system, something the leftist intellectuals got pissy about

Subscribes to authority if it claims to be for their good, e.g. big corps

Would otherwise have been christian socialism just fine

Unlike every other leftist school, this is the only one that does not believe in the crazy stuff like removing religion, family, and etc.

## 6 Social justice
Social justice. Not very long term thinking. More just not feeling bad in the short term or smth

contains numerous contradictions, so much that the only common thing between all of them is ultimately only that their adherents feel something

Is effectively just anarchism returned, but feminine (selling out, being okay with big brother government). Roi? Or just more concretely focusing solely on not feeling bad? Idfk

Is our current dominant ideology for what reason? idfk

Began with the first feminists in the 19th century, only caught on post WW2

Champions anything they think will kill capitalism
 
All about feelings and etc. idk. Very feminine

Is just closet totalitarian communism achieved via manipulation (feminine) instead of violent revolution (masculine)

They want the unconditional contribution of the men

They sold out to big corp, big gov, and well, big brother

We’re already seeing this fail horribly, and the men will put the women back into the kitchen making sandwiches or whatever they are supposed to do there

## 7 Anarcho-primitivism vs. Techno-utopianism
Today, faced with the failures of all past leftist ideologies, the more introspective and rational leftists have concluded there really only are two ways to bring about the desired leftist utopia. Those being either to adjust the world to pressure humans into a mode of constant goodwill, and thereby unconditional contributions, or to change human nature. For the former, there is either only to return to a hunter-gatherer environment, or to reshape the world via technology. And for the latter, there is of course only reshaping humans via technology, unless you have a different interpretation of darwinian evolution.

Issue is, that these two outlooks are fairly radical. For instance, most people are not comfortable with the idea of human genetic engineering, or willing to give up all their modern amenities. So it will be a lot more difficult to get the normies to support a political party championing any of these, unlike it was with historical leftism. Which is why I think most leftists will elect to stick with their old talking points, inevitably dooming the ideology when people recognize it won’t work out.

I should mention anarcho-primitivism and techno-utopianism are by no means solely leftist. Rather, reaching either of those conclusions are just convergent evolution of ideologies, sort of like how everything will eventually evolve into a crab, or how every Skyrim build becomes a sneak archer.

#posadism is anprim kind of

These are the true heirs of leftist thought. And where it goes from here with anarcho-primitivism and techno-utopianism is a whole topic to cover on its own. Maybe I will do that in the future.
