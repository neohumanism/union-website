# The Role of Centralization
![](/leviathan_hobbes.jpg)

why do we form leviathans?

The role of centralization

A leviathan must consume everything in society to survive, which is why they normally choose to die before that, so society can survive.

Auron macintyre already had “permanent revolution and tot” video about this. So idk

Could instead also be about how centing is inefficient and really only should be done in emergencies

And when else centralization makes sense (when you don't know what you need to do but you need to do something still, e.g. mars colony allergory)
