# The humanist religion and its denominations
Since the enlightenment and decline of Christianity in The West, people have still continued believing in something. That “something” can be described as “humanism”, a belief-system which roughly puts human existence in its center. Nowadays, people don’t really think about how it this affects them or wider society, much like how say christians, muslims, or buddhists see their way of viewing the world as natural without realizing how weird other societies think it is. So let us do a deep dive into what humanism really is.

## 1 Is it a religion?
The label of “religion” might seem odd on humanism, as it does not tackle spirituality like traditional religions do. And by spirituality, I mean the questions to do with intrinsic meaning relating to one’s sense of being, in other words who you truly are, for example a soul, and what you are supposed to do, say, follow certain commandments. Spirituality being from what religions derive everything else, thereby being fundamental to a belief-system even being a religion.

However, while humanism does not explicitly have any standard answers to spiritual questions, you will still see a range of ideas which do end up providing spiritual answers. This is much like most pre-axial religions, the only significant surviving one today being hinduism. To give an example, in Islam, there is a clear standard view of doing one’s duty as written in the holy texts to reach heaven, while in hinduism, some interpretations think there is a heaven, others not, and others say it doesn’t matter, with there in turn being hundreds of different ideas on what you’re supposed to do about it.

Cool, so what are the answers humanism gives to spirituality? Well, roughly, you can characterize them within the range of either nihilism, that nothing matters, agnosticism that we can’t know what matters, and existentialism, that we decide for ourselves what matters. With what happens then with these non-substantive answers, is that people just default to their emotions, their emotions guiding them for example to pursue fairness out of anger, care out of compassion, and so on. Which in its totality when viewed objectively, as opposed to from one’s own perspective, forms the idea that human beings are the center of the universe.

It is also from that that the concept of “human rights” are formed. “Human rights” being the things humans think they are entitled from the universe. What exactly these rights are depend on which denomination you ask, but all of them ultimately speak of ideas like happiness, survival, and freedom.

Now, despite humanism being a religion, its denominations need not be described as such. They simply accept the humanist idea of spirituality, and provide secular suggestions for doctrines on how one should act to bring about the humanist ideal.

And what denominations am I talking about? Well, let’s go through them.

## 2 Liberty
Freedom first

Stems from mostly existentialism

Encompasses ancap, egoism, etc.

## 3 Emotion
Fairness, compassion, safety, etc. first

They do stuff like activist LARP, partying, and caring more about not offending people than practice

It coalesced into what we refer to today as lefitsm, which is the only extant branch of this. And happens to say disgust is bad

Leftism roughly encompasses the idea that addressing concerns of fairness will lead to the highest degree of


## 4 Survival
Survival and integrity first

Nationalist, fascism, nazism


## 5 Conclusion
So with all this in mind, what have we learnt? Well, over all, I would personally say the primacy of the human condition, we can demonstrate as rather pointless without anything greater in mind.
