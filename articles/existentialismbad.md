# Existentialism?
![](/wanderer_above_the_sea_fog.jpg)

Someone asks you what the meaning of life is, and you reply “whatever you make it”. What you just said is existentialism, and what I argue is both wrong on an objective level, and often bad advice for individuals as well. Why? Well, come and find out.

## 1 Nonsubstantivism makes it useless
So first thing’s first. What does existentialism even tell you? Well, nothing. It tells you to make your own meaning out of what appears to be a meaningless existence. Yet, isn’t that what you’d already have been doing if you were to be receptive to its message to begin with? And in the case you believed there was an objective meaning, something which might appear to clash with existentialism, it actually wouldn’t, as you could just say that is the meaning you feel is correct. Hence, it does appear existentialism is almost redundant.

Not just that, but existentialism could also direct your focus away from meaning you did not make up on your own. For instance, a lot of people find their religions, utilitarianism, their community, and so on, meaningful, but they rarely made any of those themselves. And often, existentialism is imagined to be an introverted individualistic experience. Where you explore for what kind of hobbies are your passions, climb Mount Everest, or whatever. When in truth, a lot of people are still happy without really having any passionate hobbies or doing any great feats for themselves. (proof on screen).

That is not to say the exploration of what you find meaningful is bad necessarily, only that the whole philosophical school might as well not exist, as it is completely redundant.

Most people are not so bright and honest, so they can’t really make up a good meaning, good meaning without just taking up a community or religion is also incredibly difficult to make

just defaults to sensual pleasure and arbitrary. when those fail, people get depressed and commit die

or you just find something arbitrary to delude yourself into

## 2 Closet egoism
What’s more, is that existentialism is really just closet egoism. It effectively posits that the only meaning to everything is decided by your subjective whims, just like egoism. This obviously can’t be good for society on a large scale, but also can make you miserable. Imagine if you wanted to serve yourself only, but found out that was difficult. Well, then what?

Cue doomerism, which is in essence existentialist.


“Doomerism” they have existentialist optimism, when they really should just be utilitarians

Hedonism (incl. materialism) is natural result of feeling your way forth. And it’s just a treadmill according to science and etc.

## 3 Egoists destroying society

Hedonists overconsume, other hedonists see there is nothing left for them, they then become doomers and give up, the hedonists get less to consume

## 4 How to actually defeat nihilism
Existentialism fundamentally was made to combat the imposition of religious dogma, and nihilism

To actually defeat nihilism, you have two "healthy" options. Either, make enough friends and community to distract yourself and feel happy. That is scientifically proven to work. Or, the better option, discover an objective truth of how you ought to act which you find compelling. The latter is incredibly difficult however, especially when you don’t have any assumptions to start from, so .

So to be happy, you either need to just have a meaning, be bright enough to make a meaning, or get a community. With the former, there are no compelling ones nowadays, the second you probably  can’t do, and the latter incredibly difficult in our isolated world. So what to do? Not much can be done except reforming our culture.

## 5 How culture changes
Either a prophet saves you, or you die off and the amish take over
