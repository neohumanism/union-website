# Why Israel has no future
There was a certain infamous country in the Levant. It began when Europe gathered under the consensus a moral wrong had transpired, and that the creation of this country was how it ought to be rectified. The country was then set up by european conquerors, and supported military such that it won every initial military conflict. Highly religious settlers then came to the territory. They mistreated the muslim locals, forcefully displacing and slaughtering them. Which garnered their ire, and they came to desire nothing less than its destruction.  The country in question is the crusader state of Jerusalem.

Only a thousand years later did history seemingly repeat itself. Now, Israel bears striking similarities. The question then, is if the same fate that befell the crusader state will befall Israel as well.

## 1 Why did the crusader states fail?
To begin we can ask why the crusader states failed to begin with. Reasons in complex systems are difficult to segregate, but roughly speaking, they can be viewed as the following:

Reason 1: Israel is an unproductive region surrounded by productive regions. There are essentially no natural resources there, the agricultural potential is not so great, and what the region does not have, the neighboring regions of Syria, Egypt, and Iraq do have. 

Reason 2: The geography is not very defensible. To the south there is a small stretch of desert, which granted provides some protection, was not big enough to prove much of a challenge for the desert-peoples to traverse, unlike maybe the Sahara. To the north and east, there are some highlands, and there is also a river in the east, but those are again not big enough to prove a significant barrier. The only real barrier the region does have is the Mediterranean in the west, but given the history of various roving sea peoples in the Mediterranean’s history, it shouldn't be consider that too safe of a barrier either. Top that off with how the country is tiny, on par with <>, so much so that you could walk from one end to another in <> days, and you see the country is not very defensible.

Reason 3: The state was disconnected from Europe, its main "supplier". As the region was not very productive, it had to rely on Europe for constant shipments of soldiers to protect it. However, it was a stretch away from Europe without a land connection, and so had to make relatively harder amphibious landings. So if the small country got occupied it would maybe take months before the europeans could actually respond, and would not be able to land very safely if they lacked maritime dominance.

Reason 4: Europe had no practical reason for keeping the territory. In the event the country there fell, it would not have any tangible effects on Europe. The entire project was only motivated by religious fervor, and perhaps prestige, netting no practical benefits, unlike say the regions on the islamic border, like Iberia or the Balkans, which did end up seeing a lot more consistent european support against muslim incursions.

Reason 5: There were neighboring warrior-like peoples that wanted to destroy the country outnumbering them 100 times over. Combined with the fact that the country had no real chance to defend itself in the first place without constant support from Europe, it is no surprise some muslim regimes eventually managed to subjugate the region.

## 2 Does this apply to Israel?
The events then and now are removed by one thousand years, and a lot has changed since then. In current times, you could for example point to how the current regimes in Egypt and Saudi Arabia appear to be opening up to Israel, or how dedicated the western elites appear to be in supporting them, the US for instance going so far as to saying "Israel is our greatest ally".

And while you would be correct in pointing those things out, everything I mentioned previously still applies to Israel. The geography has not changed, they rely on a maritime route which could be blockaded or intercepted, and even if muslim regimes are cozying up to Israel, the populations still overwhelmingly hate Israel (which any quick internet search could confirm) to the extent the regimes can only cozy up so much before their populations begin protesting. The only factor that somewhat differs this time, is that the US wants Israel as a strategic partner to secure the oil-trade.

However, interest of the US in the region for those pragmatic purposes might not last. Recently, The US itself is self-sufficient on oil, has plenty of oil in its backyard Venezuela they could "borrow", and the american public has grown tired of intervening in middle-eastern conflicts. There is also that the West has adopted the goal of phasing out eventually phasing out oil, which while it may or may not actually happen, goes to show positive interest in oil is declining. What I mean to say here, is that even if the US has some strategic interest in the region, the US, and for that matter the rest of the West, could overall pull out of there and be fine. Thus Israel, while being a strategic interest, is not a vital one, or at least not anymore.

So it would seem the situation is almost the same. Which is bad for Israel. As in the event the US and its navy gets occupied elsewhere, say in a major war against China or an internal conflict, Israel might be left vulnerable to maritime interference and invasion by its neighbors, which even if they are able to initially withstand, they could not hold against forever given their supply situation.

## 3 Is Israel doomed?
Given all these strategic vulnerabilities, it does seem like history will repeat itself. So the question then is if this can be averted.

Of the 5 reasons I mentioned earlier, none of them are easily changed. You can't do much about the geography, artificial reasons to support them won't last, and little can be done about the hostile neighboring muslim populations.

Or could something be done about them? While you can't change the land, itself, people can change, so maybe it would be possible to reconcile with the muslims? I doubt that is possible.

Firstly, both their guiding faiths are inherently chauvinistic in a sense. Abrahamic faiths by their nature say that their one way of viewing the world is correct, that they are the chosen people, and that everyone else is either on par with livestock or an evil heretic. And while the jewish faith is somewhat declining today, it happens that the ultra-orthodox faithful haredi have consistently had the highest fertility rate, meanwhile the muslim faith is not showing any signs of decaying either. And add to this that both sides consider the region to contain important holy sites. Hence, it might just always remain popular to hate the other side.

Secondly, they compete for the same resources. The jews in Europe for most of their history there coexisted "decently" with the europeans, as the jews worked only in certain areas as they were mostly banned from agricultural work, and their population growth did not outpace the europeans. Meanwhile, in The Middle-East today, the israelites want to occupy the same land as the muslims, and their population grows rapidly, in some cases faster than the muslim ones. For the muslims, it could easily appear like the israelites are aiming to replace them, and vica versa.

So I find coexistence unlikely to work out.

Alright, so if coexistence would not work, then would Israel just have to depopulate all the muslims in the Middle-East to survive? Discounting humanitarian considerations, the end result would indeed see Israel secured. However, getting there would in practice be impossible. The muslim peoples there are hundreds of millions, from warrior-cultures with a religion that glorifies martial prowess, and with family-units that foster group cohesion. Also, at that level of destruction, even the West might turn against Israel.

What could work instead, is if the israelites relocated their state to a geographically more secure region. Say, Anatolia, Armenia, or the Caucasus. Though, the locals there probably would not be so happy about that either. Only if you had a time-machine, could you solve this by directing Moses to a better geographical region. It is also worth noting those regions also did historically fall to muslim conquests too.

## 4 The future
In the light of all this, Israel’s foreign policy does make some sense. With for example why they wanted a casus belli to occupy Gaza, why they illegally occupied the Golan Heights, or why they are encroaching into the the arab-designated eastern highlands (the West Bank). It would all provide the country with some more geographic security.

However, all that would ultimately not be enough, as their geopolitical position would on the grand scale be the same. With both practical and humanitarian considerations in mind, it might be best to give up on the zionist project.
