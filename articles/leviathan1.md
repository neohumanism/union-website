# Why Horseshoe Theory is actually correct: Closet communism and the leviathan pipeline
Horseshoe theory. I know - You think it’s a joke, given that it more so describes the authoritarianism of the recent historical extremist regimes, as opposed to its actual thesis, that political extremism inevitably results in similarities in policy-making, governance, and so on. However, an honest analysis of how political extremism would necessarily have to change society to follow its desired values, would in fact lend some credence to the idea political extremes would have to operate a certain way.

For instance, there has been the observation that most extremist revolutions that have occurred historically always ended up resulting in the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, even if that was not their original intended goal, most notably with the historical communists. Here, it almost appears there is some kind of pipeline between believing in something strongly, and then supporting a totalitarian regime to enforce those values.

Well, so is there? Is horseshoe theory correct?

## 1 Mechanism of the leviathan pipeline
Okay, so we can first ask, what exactly the mechanism for such a pipeline would be. That, I think would be fairly intuitive - That ideals which do not automatically manifest themselves into reality, would naturally require some kind of cohesive effort to be manifested. Hence, it makes sense for example that the historical nazis created a totalitarian state to kill off the undesirables to attain their desired racial purity, just as it made sense for the communists to support a totalitarian state to socially engineer the masses until they became “enlightened” enough to autonomously operate a stateless utopia.

So to further test this proposal for a mechanism, we can take some random ideas and think about how they rationally would need to be brought into reality if we wanted to:

Take the ideal of eugenics. It is of course a natural result of reality that the better genes will eventually survive, but ideas like breeding projects and arbitrarily deciding some genetic populations should all of a sudden be exterminated, would of course have no way of happening without a powerful force to see it through.

Or take the ideal of religious unity under one faith. Say what the christians and muslims of old aspired to have. Only when the catholic church in west Europe still was respected, or when there was a universal islamic caliph every muslim respected . These theocratic forces were by no means totalitarian - At that time, they couldn’t really be with any effectiveness. Instead, it just goes to show that . And given that these clerical institutions were built on loose respect, it is no surprise they easily ended up fracturing into for example protestantism or shiism, and the goal of religious unity easily failed. If only they had a perpetual dictatorship to enforce whatever they deemed as the “correct” way of thought, would this not have happened.

Or take the ideal of equal wages. In a world where every type of work was demanded equally much by the market, everyone worked equally productively, and there were no power imbalances, would there be equal wages without the need for an external force to enforce it. However, that is not the case, with some people for example being lazier than others, or for example some jobs very few people are qualified for, and others very many, or some jobs that are more demanded than others. Either way, these matters of fact are very unlikely to just spontaneously change towards what the ideal would require. Hence, there would be no way of achieving absolute wage equality without the help of an external force, which would have to be a strong-handed fanatical government.

## 2 Is the leviathan pipeline inevitable?
So what it appears like, is that if you care about any value or hold any ideal, you will inevitably need to support a kind of totalitarian dictatorship to see it come to fruition. Of course, that’s obviously not correct, given the historical precedents of many values indeed being practiced without the need for any totalitarianism. Notably how cultures around the world appear to have no problem championing their culture without the need for any external force to tell them to do so.

The reason why they can get away with that, is very naturally that they do not need an external force to maintain the values, as the values in some way maintain themselves. That is for example with how a lot of a culture’s practices happen to benefit the integrity of which culture, for example that it is commonly recognized as a duty to protect your people from foreign invaders, or how in a lot of cultures there are strict familial and marital customs.

In conclusion, the main take away here is that any ideal that does not have a proper mechanism for sustaining itself is a leviathan in sheep’s clothing.

## 3 What we can learn from this
Okay great, so now we know that there is such a thing as a leviathan pipeline. The question then might be how this would matter for us today with the culture war going on in politics and all. What we can say here, is that many proponents of various ideas, are actually just closet totalitarians, often unbeknownst to themselves. What I’m mainly talking about here, using the political compass, would be the so-called libertarian left.

They check the criteria of desiring plenty of ideals which would not sustain themselves.


Libleft is a scam that actually just shills for authleft, cuz human nature bad and cannot sustain libleft utopia

Examples of modern day libleft grift talking points that are actually would just result in totalitarian slavery
