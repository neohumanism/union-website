need a system for media

properties:
- title
- description
- thumbnail
- content
- type (e.g. brochure, article, meme)
- meta tagging (e.g. formal, boomer understandable, informal)
- content tagging (e.g. politics, environment, war, racism)
- publish date
- edit date
- author(s)

you know, we should probably make a in-site interface for that, cuz it gets fairly complex
make sure it writes into user's browser cache, and prevents browser from being closed for robustness
you don't write the content directly into there however. that is uploaded via a file (e.g. article.md, brochure.pdf)

all of those need to be accessible by search for tag (to include and to exclude)
